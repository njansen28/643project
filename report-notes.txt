Things to have tables and/or graphs of:

* II of ROW loop -> resource utilization and timing
* II of COL loop -> resource utilization and timing
* Overall speed data points:
	* Non-SIMD software
	* SIMD software
	* Single element FPGA (ROW not pipelined)
	* Single element FPGA (ROW pipelined)
	* Many element FPGA

Other things:

* Recap of problem/algorithm
* Explain our variant of algorithm
* Screenshot of block diagram(s)
